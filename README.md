Data: 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Food 101 and Dogs vs Cats Data: 

Please put DogsCats and Food folders in other location and remember to unzip the data into those folders respectively.

For example : DogsCats/train DogsCats/val etc.

After typing sh build.sh, it will create tfrecords file in the same folder.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Models and Autotune logs should also unzip to the same folder in this project.

To see the operations in detail, please refer to the ppt in this project.
